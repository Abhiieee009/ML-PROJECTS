Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a machine learning classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict whether a person has heart disease or not, based on health-related features.


Description
The dataset contains 1025 entries with 13 features each, related to heart health and measurements. The target variable is binary:
0 = No heart disease (healthy)
1 = Heart disease present (defective heart)


The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. The performance is evaluated based on accuracy.
